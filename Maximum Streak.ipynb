    "A project manager wants to look at employee attendance data. Given that m employees are working on the project, and the manager has the record of the employees present on n days of the project, help him find the maximum number of consecutive days on which all employees were present and working on the project.\n",

    "As an example there are m = 3 employees and n = 5 workdays to analyze. The attendance data strings, data = [YYY, YYY, YNN, YYN, YYN]. There are only two days at the beginning of the period , where all worker are present. Using zero indexing for employees, employees 1 and 2 are absent on the third day, and employee 2 is also out on the forth and fifth days. The maximum streak occurs at the beginning and is 2 days long.\n",
